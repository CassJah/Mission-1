The Client
Turners Car Auctions is a market leader in the automotive industry in New Zealand, responsible for more than 10% of all used vehicle sales in the country. It has retained its original function as a vehicle auctioneer, operating in 19 branches nationwide, but has become increasingly dependent on a parallel role as a conventional used vehicle dealership. In support of that role, it has established in-house finance and vehicle insurance divisions that allow it to offer buyers a complete “one-stop shop” experience.

 

The Project Brief
Turners is currently undertaking a major re-design of its motor vehicle insurance systems and processes, including an investigation of ways in which the introduction of new technologies can enhance the buyer experience. Here is some information about motor vehicle insurance at Turners [https://www.turners.co.nz/Cars/finance-insurance/car-insurance/].  You have just been assigned to the project team to help create a new insurance buying experience.
